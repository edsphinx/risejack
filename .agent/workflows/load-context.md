Before starting any work on RiseCasino, read the following files to understand the project:

## 1. Project Context

Read the current project state:

```
/home/edsphinx/Blockchain/RiseJack (Mobile)/ai-context-hub/projects/risecasino/context.md
```

## 2. Tech Stack Preferences

Understand the preferred technologies:

```
/home/edsphinx/Blockchain/RiseJack (Mobile)/ai-context-hub/shared/tech-stack.md
```

## 3. Code Style

Follow these conventions:

```
/home/edsphinx/Blockchain/RiseJack (Mobile)/ai-context-hub/shared/code-style.md
```

## 4. User Preferences

Understand communication style:

```
/home/edsphinx/Blockchain/RiseJack (Mobile)/ai-context-hub/shared/preferences.md
```

## 5. Recent Sessions (Optional)

Check recent chat logs for context:

```
